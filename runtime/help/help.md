# Introduction
- jsmdcui stands for:
- JavaScript Markdown Cross-environment User Interface
- The goal is to use Markdown as a Common UI for Terminals and Web Browsers
  * TUI = Terminal User Interface
  * WUI = Web User Interface
- .
- It's based on bunmicro, a terminal text editor derived from the Micro text editor

- Original projects:
- https://github.com/jjtseng93/bunmicro
- https://github.com/micro-editor/micro
- .
- This README is itself a runnable app.

```sh
npx jsmdcui@latest README.md
```

## Quick start

jsmdcui requires [Bun ≥ 1.3.12](https://bun.com).
 On Android, install it in Termux:

```sh
npm install -g bun
```

On other platforms, follow the [official Bun installation guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

Choose either of these two ways to run jsmdcui.

> **Important:** Opening or rendering a local `.md` file writes or overwrites
> 5 generated files beside it. 
> Starting `--wui` without a file or starting all the `--demo`s writes the
> 5 files generated from `testapp.md` in the current directory. 
> The source Markdown is not changed, but you should run the demo in a directory where
> overwriting generated files is safe.

### Route 1: Run with npx

- This route requires both `npx` and `bun` on your `PATH`; no source checkout is
required. 

#### Open the normal terminal editor

```sh
npx jsmdcui
```

#### Start `testapp.md` as the TUI/WUI demo
- If `testapp.md` is missing, the bundled copy is written to the current working directory
- If `testapp.md` already exists, it will be used and won't be overwritten.

```sh
# TUI(Terminal User Interface) Demo
npx jsmdcui --demo
```

List every bundled demo and its command-line option:

```sh
npx jsmdcui --demo-list
```

```sh
# Bun.Image processor demo
npx jsmdcui --demo-imgtool
```

```sh
# Traditional Chinese Bun.Image processor demo
npx jsmdcui --demo-imgtool-zh
```

```sh
# Maze game demo
npx jsmdcui --demo-maze
```

```sh
# Event context, heading references, and state demo
npx jsmdcui --demo-event
```

To watch jsmdcui start the maze with a local CDP server and solve it
automatically after three seconds, run:

```sh
npx jsmdcui --cdp-maze
```

```sh
# WUI(Web User Interface) Demo
npx jsmdcui --wui
```

#### Open your own Markdown CUI App

```sh
npx jsmdcui app.md
npx jsmdcui --wui app.md
```

### Route 2: Clone the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jjtseng93/jsmdcui.git
cd jsmdcui
bun src/index.js testapp.md
```

- The last command opens the included demo in the terminal
- Use arrow keys to move around
- `Enter`, `Space`, or mouse click to activate an item, and `Ctrl-Q` to quit.
- To open the same demo in a browser instead:

```sh
bun src/index.js --wui testapp.md
```

- After starting `--wui`, open the last printed `http://...` URL in a browser.
- Keep the command running while using the CUI App, and press `Ctrl-C` in that terminal to stop the server.

### Usage table

- The command table below assumes you're running from a cloned repository 
- If you use npx, replace `bun src/index.js` with `npx jsmdcui`

- I've also provided short aliases
  * bun ./tui = bun src/index.js
  * bun ./wui = bun src/index.js --wui

options.

## Write a Markdown UI

Create `app.md`:

````md
## My app

- [Say hello](javascript:sayHello())
- [Get server time](javascript:showServerTime())
- [Update text box](javascript:updateText())
- [Show selected](javascript:alert(JSON.stringify($('#my-app').val())))
- [x] task1
- [x] task2
- [ ] unselected task

```text#myid.myclass
Editable in both TUI and WUI
```

```js front
export function sayHello() {
  const name = prompt("Your name:", "World");
  if (name) alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

export async function showServerTime() {
  const time = await rpc.getServerTime();
  alert(time);
}

export function updateText() {
  $('#myid').val($('.myclass').val() + ' ✓');
}
```

```js back
export function getServerTime() {
  return new Date().toISOString();
}
```
````

Open it in either UI:

```sh
bun src/index.js app.md
bun src/index.js --wui app.md
```

- The resulting App UI is shown at the beginning of this README.md
- Run this demo app directly by:
  * bun src/index.js README.md
  * If you didn't clone the repo, use --export-readme to write README.md to the current folder

### Text blocks

Both `text` and `textarea` fenced blocks define editable text fields:

````md
```text#message.note
Initial value
```
````

A fenced-block declaration must include a tag. Its supported identity syntax is
`tag`, optionally followed by `#id` and one or more `.class` names, for
example `text#message.note` or `textarea#notes.readonly`. Tags and class names
must begin with an ASCII letter or underscore; their remaining characters may
also include digits, `_`, `-`, and `:`. IDs may begin with `_` or a Unicode
letter or number; later characters may additionally be Unicode combining
marks, `_`, `-`, or `:`. Declarations such as `#message` and `#message.note`
have no tag and are therefore not recognized as selectable fenced blocks.

The currently supported fenced-block tags are only `text` and `textarea` so
the same control works consistently in both the TUI and WUI. Selector queries
may omit the tag or classes after a valid declaration, so all of
`$('text#message.note')`, `$('text#message')`, `$('#message.note')`, and
`$('#message')` can select the example above.

Named controls and their `@keydown` declarations are recognized inside
blockquotes and list items as well as at the top level.

The same Markdown works in both interfaces. In the browser WUI it becomes a
native `<textarea>` with the declared ID and classes. Long text wraps
automatically, and the field height is recalculated when the user types, the
window is resized, or frontend code calls `.val(value)`.

In the TUI, `text` remains a single-line control while `textarea` supports
native multiline editing. Enter splits the current body row and grows the
frame, Backspace at the start of a later row joins it to the previous row, and
Delete at the end of a row joins the following row. When the expanded control
does not fit on screen, the document viewport scrolls to keep the cursor
visible. The closing border and following Markdown content move with the
resized control.

A named `text` or `textarea` block can run inline front-end code before it
handles a key by placing a quoted HTML-style `@keydown` attribute after its
identity:

````md
```text#command.field @keydown="handleCommand(event)"
Initial value
```

```js front
export function handleCommand(event) {
  if (event.key !== 'Enter') return;
  event.preventDefault();
  alert(`Command: ${$('#command').val()}`);
}
```
````

The block must have a unique ID. Both interfaces run the handler before their
normal text-editing behavior and expose a consistent key and modifier state.
The WUI also normalizes ordinary character input reported by software
keyboards.

On Android browsers, `Alt-E`, `Alt-N`, `Alt-U`, and `Alt-I` may be consumed or
transformed by the software keyboard and therefore cannot always be observed
reliably by a keydown handler. Avoid relying on these combinations for portable
WUI controls.

Both interfaces expose `event.key`, modifier flags, `event.target.id`, and
`event.target.value`. Use `event`, the native inline-handler variable, rather
than Vue's `$event` alias. Double quotes delimit the handler; use single-quoted
JavaScript strings inside it or escape an embedded double quote as `\"`.

Both interfaces add a non-enumerable `event.toJSON()` method with matching
keyboard, modifier, prevention, and target fields. `JSON.stringify(event)`
calls it automatically, so the resulting JSON is portable between the TUI and
WUI.

A keydown handler can call `event.preventDefault()` to stop text insertion or
cursor movement. The `.prevent` modifier applies this automatically:

````md
```text#command @keydown.prevent="handleCommand(event)"
```
````

`@keydown` is the only keyboard event exposed by jsmdcui. Traditional terminal
input does not report physical key releases reliably, so jsmdcui does not
provide or emulate `@keyup` in either interface.

In the terminal TUI, only content after the protected `│ ` or `| ` prefix can
be edited, and the frame prefix cannot be deleted. Multiline paste remains
blocked. For single-line `text` controls, activate the lower-left frame corner
to add a row. Activate the upper-left frame corner to remove the trailing row
only when it is empty; non-empty content is never removed.

TUI text-control changes made through `.val(value)` participate in the same
history as direct editing. `Ctrl-Z` undoes the replacement and `Ctrl-Y` redoes
it, including multiline frame resizing and its associated rendered metadata.

### Heading task lists and selector API

Headings can act as form-group selectors. For example, `## Select Color`
becomes `#select-color`. When the usual generated ID would be empty, jsmdcui
normalizes the heading's visible Unicode text instead:
`## 使用者 設定！` becomes `#使用者-設定`. When normalization yields no usable
ID characters, the heading receives a stable `mdcui-h-...` fallback ID. A
heading referenced by app code should contain a meaningful letter or number;
treat `mdcui-h-...` as a fallback rather than hard-coding its hash. A heading
selection reads direct task items from the first list in the same Markdown
container after that heading. The search stops at the next heading or when the
enclosing blockquote or list item ends. In the TUI, the first rendered `☐` or
`☒` establishes that list and its indentation. Nested task items are not
included in the outer list's value.

Heading IDs share the same selector namespace as all explicitly named fenced
blocks, not only `text` and `textarea`, so avoid name collisions between them.
For example, `## Write Status` generates `#write-status` and must not be used
together with a block such as `text#write-status` or
`textarea#write-status`.
Otherwise, `$('#write-status')` may select the heading instead of the block and
updates can appear to do nothing. Rename either declaration so every
selectable ID is unique.

Duplicate source headings are treated as collisions when they generate the
same base ID. Give each heading a name that produces a unique ID; do not rely
on automatically added numeric suffixes.

Run `bun src/index.js --check app.md` (or `jsmdcui --check app.md`) to
check these IDs without opening either UI or writing generated files. The
command prints each collision with its source type, line number, and original
declaration, then exits immediately. Its exit status is `0` when all IDs are
unique, `1` when collisions are found, and `2` for invalid arguments or read
errors.

Run `bun src/index.js --outline app.md` (or `jsmdcui --outline app.md`) to
print the same selectable IDs as a compact outline. Heading IDs use indented
`-` items according to their heading level, while every named fenced block is
a top-level `+` item. Duplicate IDs are printed rather than treated as an
outline error; use `--check` when collisions should fail the command.

If the heading ID begins with `select`, `.val()` behaves like a single select:
it returns the first checked item or `null`. Other heading IDs behave like a
multiple select and return all checked items as an array, or `[]` when none are
checked.

Heading values contain the complete visible label, including any explanatory
text. When interpreting a selection, prefer `value.includes(...)` (or another
deliberate prefix/token parser) unless labels are guaranteed to be exact,
stable identifiers. For example, `yes（flip vertically）` should not be tested
with `value === "yes"`.

````md
## Select Color

- [ ] Red
- [x] Green
- [ ] Blue

## Features

- [x] Search
- [ ] Notifications
- [x] Offline mode

```js front
export function showValues() {
  alert(JSON.stringify({
    color: $('#select-color').val(),
    features: $('#features').val(),
  }));
}
```
````

The same getter works in TUI and WUI:

```js
$('#select-color').val() // "Green"
$('#features').val()     // ["Search", "Offline mode"]
```

The first direct task list belonging to a heading can also be changed with
Array-style methods. String arguments create unchecked items. Pass an object
to choose the initial checked state:

```js
$('#features').push('Export')
$('#features').unshift({ value: 'Import', checked: true })
$('#features').splice(1, 2, 'Replacement')
$('#features').slice(0, 2)
$('#features').pop()
$('#features').shift()
```

Like the corresponding `Array.prototype` methods, `.push(...items)` and
`.unshift(...items)` accept multiple items and return the new number of direct
items. `.pop()` and `.shift()` return the removed item's visible label, or
`undefined` when the list is empty. Nested task items are part of their parent
item: they are not counted separately, and are removed together with that
parent. These methods change the rendered TUI/WUI state; they do not rewrite
the source Markdown file. A heading must already have a task list before items
can be added. If API mutations remove its final item, it still counts as that
heading's existing list, so a later `.push()` or `.unshift()` repopulates the
same position after hide/show, text-control row changes, or a TUI rerender.

`.splice(start, deleteCount, ...items)` follows `Array.prototype.splice()`:
negative indexes count from the end, omitting `deleteCount` removes through the
end, and the return value is an array containing the removed visible labels.

`.slice(start, end)` is read-only and follows `Array.prototype.slice()`. It
returns fresh item snapshots, including unchecked items, so changing the
returned array or its objects does not change the rendered list:

```js
$('#features').slice()
// [
//   { value: 'Search', checked: true },
//   { value: 'Notifications', checked: false },
// ]
```

`demos/todo.md` and `demos/todo-zh.md` are runnable Todo examples that
demonstrate `.push()`,
`.splice()`, `.slice()`, and `{ value, checked }` snapshots using editable text
controls instead of `prompt()` dialogs. Materialize one in the current
directory with its demo flag, or open the source-tree copy directly:

```sh
bun src/index.js --demo-todo
bun src/index.js --demo-todo-zh
bun src/index.js demos/todo.md
bun src/index.js --wui demos/todo-zh.md
```

The bundled `demos/select.md` is a multilevel runnable example. Use `--demo-select`
to write it into the current directory when missing and open it in the TUI, or
open it explicitly in either interface:

```sh
bun src/index.js --demo-select
bun src/index.js demos/select.md
bun src/index.js --wui demos/select.md
```

The available selector methods are:

`★★` means the API is intended for portable use in both the TUI and WUI.

| Method | TUI | WUI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `★★ .id` | Return the selection's resolved ID; nested `$($($(selection)))` wrappers retain it. | Same. |
| `★★ .val()` | Read text blocks or heading task-list values. | Read textareas/controls or heading task-list values. |
| `★★ .val(value)` | Replace text-block contents, resize multiline values, and record Undo/Redo history. | Set textarea/control values and resize textareas. |
| `★★ .text()` | Return a heading's rendered visible text or an object target's `textContent`. Heading string-selector setters are intentionally unsupported. | Read an element's `textContent`; `.text(value)` also updates it. |
| `★★ .show()`, `.hide()`, `.toggle()` | Keep the heading visible and show or hide its section body. | Same. |
| `★★ .data()`, `.data(key, value)` | Read or update user data associated with the selection ID. | Same. |
| `★★ .removeData(...)` | Remove selected user keys or all user data without changing heading visibility. | Same. |
| `★★ .push(...items)` | Append unchecked strings or `{ value, checked }` task items; return the new direct-item count. | Same. |
| `★★ .pop()` | Remove and return the last direct task item's label, or `undefined`. | Same. |
| `★★ .shift()` | Remove and return the first direct task item's label, or `undefined`. | Same. |
| `★★ .unshift(...items)` | Prepend unchecked strings or `{ value, checked }` task items; return the new direct-item count. | Same. |
| `★★ .splice(start, deleteCount, ...items)` | Remove and insert direct task items; return the removed labels as an array. | Same. |
| `★★ .slice(start, end)` | Return `{ value, checked }` snapshots without changing the direct task items. | Same. |
| `.html()` | For a heading selector, return its rendered inline HTML from the source Markdown. For an object target, read that object's own `innerHTML` property. There is no TUI DOM. | Return any successfully selected DOM element's actual `innerHTML`. |
| `.line()` | Return a heading's current 1-based TUI row, or `0` if missing. | Not available. |

Every `$()` selection exposes its resolved `.id`. Passing an object with a
legal MDCUI ID immediately canonicalizes it to the same path as `$('#id')`.
The original object's other fields are not retained, so repeated wrapping
follows that ID path at any nesting depth. Objects without a legal ID keep
their generic object-target behavior:

```js
const source = { id: 'features', value: 'ignored after selection' }
const heading = $(source)       // exactly the same target as $('#features')
source.id = 'something-else'    // does not retarget heading
const nested = $($($($(heading))))

nested.id                 // "features"
nested.text()
nested.data() === heading.data()
```

User data belongs to the resolved ID and remains available while the document
is open, including when the corresponding WUI element is temporarily replaced.
Calling `.removeData()` does not change heading visibility.

### Heading visibility boundaries

`$('#topic').hide()` keeps the heading visible and hides its content through the
next heading of equal or higher level, or through the end of its enclosing
blockquote or list item, whichever comes first. Lower-level headings and their
content belong to that section. `.show()` reveals it, and `.toggle()` switches
between the two states in both interfaces.

The first visible character of an identified Markdown heading is also a fixed
toggle target. Activate it with a mouse click, `Enter`, or `Space`. Markdown
headings always receive a nonempty ID.

Raw HTML headings follow interface-native behavior instead. In the WUI, an
`h1`-`h6` with a nonempty `id` remains a DOM heading and receives a toggle; a
legal MDCUI ID also makes it selectable through `$()`. The TUI renders raw HTML
as literal text, so it is not a TUI heading selector or toggle target. Raw
heading IDs are still included in `--check` collision detection.

To change a TUI task list, its heading must be visible and must already contain
a direct task list. Otherwise the mutation returns its normal empty result
without changing a child heading's list or creating a new one.

### Event context

A local `javascript:` Markdown link runs with a link-shaped `this` and matching
event targets in both interfaces:

```md
[Inspect](javascript:inspect(this,event))
```

```js
export function inspect(target, event) {
  console.log($(target).text())
  console.log($(event.target).text())
  console.log(event.type)
  console.log(event.target === target)
  console.log(event.currentTarget === target)
}
```

For a TUI OSC 8 link, jsmdcui provides an anchor-like target containing
`tagName`, `href`, `textContent`, and `innerHTML`. Wrapped links remain active
on every displayed row. When jsmdcui can match the link to the current Markdown
source, `innerHTML` contains rendered inline HTML for its label; otherwise it
falls back to `textContent`. Mouse activation reports
`event.type === "click"`. `Enter` and `Space` report
`event.type === "keydown"` with standard `event.key` values. In the WUI, the
native anchor is used as `this` and as both event targets.

Fence keydown code may likewise receive both values explicitly:

````md
```text#command @keydown.prevent="handleKey(this,event)"
Focus here
```
````

Both interfaces bind the control as `this`, `event.target`, and
`event.currentTarget`. The TUI target is synthetic and provides a live
`value`; the WUI target is the native `<textarea>`.

For a complete interactive example in either interface, run:

```sh
bun src/index.js --demo-event
bun src/index.js --wui --demo-event
```

The demo reports results in its bottom **Output Console** and covers link
`this`, event targets, keyboard fields, nested `$()` selections, heading data,
and heading visibility.

### TUI resize behavior

Changing terminal or split width rerenders MDCUI while preserving heading
visibility, task-list changes made through the heading API, direct checkbox
state, and fenced-control contents. Multiline `.val(value)` changes also update
later heading positions.

State changed through public `$()` control and heading APIs is supported.
Arbitrary screen-row edits made through low-level editor APIs are outside this
preservation guarantee.

The 3 UI building blocks are:

- 1. `Regular Markdown` provides headings, text, lists, task checkboxes, code, and
  links.
- 2. `js front` block contains UI code. Exported functions can use
  `alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, and the generated `rpc` client.
  * A front module may export `async function onMdcuiExit({ reason, path, $ })`.
  * The terminal UI awaits it before closing an `mdcui` buffer. 
  * Modified `mdcui` buffers close without a save prompt.
- 3. `js back` block exports trusted backend functions. In the browser WUI,
  `rpc` publishes only exported functions whose exported names do not start
  with `_`. Call a published function from the front end with
  `await rpc.functionName(arg1, arg2)`.

> An `_` prefix only hides a function from the browser WUI RPC interface. The
> local terminal UI imports the backend module directly, so `_` is a naming
> convention, not authentication or a security boundary. Use a name without
> `_` for a function that must work through RPC in both UIs.

Use a `javascript:` Markdown link to run front-end code:

```md
[Button label](javascript:exportedFunction())
```

Use `onMdcuiExit` when a terminal Markdown app needs to submit or otherwise
process edited fields before it closes:

```js
export async function onMdcuiExit({ reason, path, $ }) {
  await rpc.saveDraft({
    reason,
    path,
    message: $('#message').val(),
  });
}
```

The callback is optional, may be asynchronous, and is called at most once for
each mdcui buffer.

The front and back code blocks are not shown in the rendered UI. The generated
`rpc` client presents the same exported backend functions in both interfaces.

## Terminal interaction

Markdown files automatically use `mdcui` mode. Most rendered content remains
protected, while `text` block content rows can be edited. Navigation,
selection, search, and copy remain available.

| Input | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Arrow keys, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown` | Move through the rendered UI. |
| `Enter` or `Space` | Activate the cell under the cursor. Put the cursor on a `javascript:` link to run it, or on or to the right of `☐` or `☒` to toggle that task. |
| Left click | Move to and activate the clicked cell. A `javascript:` link runs immediately; clicking on or to the right of `☐` or `☒` toggles that task. |
| Mouse wheel | Scroll three rows at a time. |
| `Shift` + arrow keys | Select rendered text. |
| `Ctrl-C` | Copy the selection, or the current line when nothing is selected. |
| `Ctrl-A` | Select all rendered text. |
| `Ctrl-F` | Search; use `Ctrl-N` and `Ctrl-P` for the next and previous match. |
| `Ctrl-G` | Open the editor help. |
| `Alt-G` | Show or hide the shortcut bar. |
| `Ctrl-Q` or `Alt-Q` | Close the current UI. |

To preview another color theme, press `Ctrl-E` or click on `€`, type `theme `, then use `Tab`
and the arrow keys to browse the available themes. Press `Enter` to switch to
the selected theme, or `Esc` to cancel and restore the previous one.

The terminal automatically reflows the Markdown when its width changes.
Only `javascript:` links execute in the TUI; ordinary web links behave as
normal links in the browser.

Local Markdown images are displayed automatically in terminals that support
the Kitty graphics protocol. Relative image paths are resolved from the
Markdown file's directory. jsmdcui reads the image dimensions, reserves the
corresponding terminal rows, and updates the placement when the document is
scrolled, resized, or shown in a split pane. Unsupported or missing images, as
well as remote images not authorized with `--allow-url`, retain Bun's normal
linked `📷` fallback. All remote images in one TUI render share a 10-second
download budget; timed-out images are aborted and keep the same fallback. To
download trusted remote Markdown and display its supported HTTP(S) images with
Kitty graphics, combine the options:

```sh
bun src/index.js --kitty --allow-url https://example.com/app.md
```

Images referenced by an app built with `--build-md-exe` are embedded and remain
available to both the compiled WUI and Kitty-capable TUI. No second asset copy
is required.

To make a no-argument compiled app enable standard Kitty-compatible rendering
immediately, inline the environment-mode value at build time:

```sh
npx jsmdcui --build-md-exe myapp.md \
  --define process.env.JSMDCUI_KITTY_MODE=compat
```

For the jsgotty MIME extension, use `extended` instead:

```sh
npx jsmdcui --build-md-exe myapp.md \
  --define process.env.JSMDCUI_KITTY_MODE=extended
```

Use the global expression `process.env.JSMDCUI_KITTY_MODE` exactly as shown;
do not import or alias `process`, because build-time definitions match that
expression.

### CDP control for TUI automation

The terminal UI can expose a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) server, so another
Bun process can inspect the terminal buffer, click buffer coordinates, and send
real keyboard events to the running TUI.

Start CDP from the command line when launching jsmdcui:

```sh
bun src/index.js --remote-debugging-port=9222 demos/maze.md
bun src/index.js --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1 demos/maze.md
```

Or start it from inside the TUI editor command prompt(Ctrl-E or €):

```text
Ctrl-E  cdp
Ctrl-E  cdp 9000
Ctrl-E  cdp --address=127.0.0.1
Ctrl-E  cdp 9000 --public
```

The default bind address is `127.0.0.1` and the default port is `9222`.
Use `--public` or `--address=0.0.0.0` only on a trusted network.

Once CDP is running, control the TUI with `Bun.WebView`. For more info, enter
jsmdcui and use `Ctrl-E` or `€` → `help cdp`.

The cli flag `--cdp-maze` is a combination of 
  1. Start the demos/maze.md
  2. Start a local CDP server
  3. Wait three seconds
  4. Run the solver cdp-maze.js automatically
  
The solver was
generated from the `llm-maze.txt` instructions; it focuses the maze controls,
resets the game, reads the maze from the TUI, solves it with breadth-first
search, and sends arrow-key input until the maze is escaped:

```sh
npx jsmdcui@latest --cdp-maze
```

From the source tree, run:

```sh
bun src/index.js --cdp-maze
```

Useful automation methods used by `cdp-maze.js`:

- `view.evaluate(js)`
  - `view.evaluate("micro.getAllText()")`
  - `view.evaluate("micro.getAllAnsiText()")`
- `view.click(column, line)`
- `view.press(key, options)`

## Browser interaction

The WUI uses normal browser mouse and keyboard behavior. Clicking a
`javascript:` link calls its front-end function, regular links navigate
normally, and task checkboxes can be toggled by clicking either the checkbox or
its associated text. `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` use the browser's built-in
dialogs. Checkbox changes exist only in the current page: refreshing does not
preserve them and does not update the Markdown file.

The WUI first tries port `3000` and accepts connections through the machine's
available network interfaces. If port `3000` is already in use, the operating
system selects an available port instead; the printed URL always contains the
actual port. Set `PORT` to request another fixed port. The printed `localhost`
URL is for the same machine. From another device on the same network, replace
`localhost` with the server machine's IP address and keep the printed port and
full path.

Each server start prints a new random path. The old URL stops working after the
server is stopped or restarted. Keep the process running while using the page,
and press `Ctrl-C` in its terminal to stop it.

## Editing Markdown source

From a cloned repository, use the `edit` launcher to open a Markdown file as
ordinary editable UTF-8 source instead of rendering it as a Markdown UI:

```sh
bun ./edit app.md
```

This is equivalent to:

```sh
bun src/index.js --edit app.md
```

Additional file and cursor arguments are forwarded unchanged.

## Generated files

Opening a local Markdown UI generates these files beside the source file:

```text
app.md.front.js
app.md.back.js
app.md.html
app.md-rpc.js
app.md-server.js
```

They are regenerated from `app.md`, so edit the Markdown source rather than the
generated files. The source directory must be writable.

From the project directory, remove generated `*.md.*` and `*.md-*` companion
files while keeping the Markdown source files:

```sh
bun ./clean.sh
```

## Security

A Markdown UI is an executable application, not a passive document. Starting a
WUI loads its backend module, loading the page runs its frontend module, and
activating a local terminal `javascript:` link runs frontend code. Backend and
terminal code can read or change files, start programs, access the network, and
read environment data with the permissions of the jsmdcui process. Only open
or serve Markdown UI files that you trust.

### WUI network exposure

> **Warning:** The WUI is intended for local or trusted-network use. It is not
> a production web server.

- There is no login, per-user authorization, or HTTPS. Traffic and results are
  sent over plain HTTP.
- The server may be reachable from other devices through the machine's network
  interfaces, even though the printed URL says `localhost`.
- The random path makes the URL harder to guess, but it is not a password.
  Anyone who can reach the server and obtains the complete URL can load the
  page and call every backend function published through WUI RPC, using
  arguments they choose.
- A backend RPC function runs with the same operating-system permissions as
  jsmdcui. Its code determines what files, commands, network services, or
  secrets a visitor may be able to reach.
- Do not share the complete URL, forward the port to the public internet, or
  run the WUI on an untrusted network. Use a firewall when needed and stop the
  server with `Ctrl-C` as soon as you finish.
- Prefixing a backend export with `_` keeps it out of WUI RPC discovery and
  calls, but it does not protect the backend module from trusted local code and
  is not a substitute for authentication.

## Distribution

### Text editor distribution

Distributions intended primarily as text editors can include an empty
`src/MDCUI_DEFAULT_EDIT` file. When this marker exists, opening a `.md` file uses the
normal editable UTF-8 view instead of automatically entering `mdcui` mode.
Markdown UI support remains available explicitly with `--mdcui` or `--tui`;
both are equivalent to `-encoding mdcui`.

### Build-time distribution constants

The following switch defines are presence-based: the program checks whether
they were passed, not whether their values are true. Consequently, `=0` and
`=false` still enable a switch. Omit a define entirely to disable it. Examples
use `=1` to make this explicit.

- `MDCUI_DEFAULT_EDIT=1`: open files as editable text by default.
- `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO=1`: add `--demo` when launched without arguments.
- `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI=1`: add `--wui` when launched without arguments.
- `MDCUI_OVERWRITE_DEMO=1`: add `--overwrite-demo`; this modifies a selected
  demo but does not select one by itself.
- `global.MDCUI_MAIN=<path>.md`: embed a custom Markdown application and its
  generated front, RPC, back, HTML, and server modules. When this define is
  forwarded after `--build-exe` or `--build-for`, a non-primitive value such as
  a bare path is automatically encoded as a JavaScript string. An explicitly
  quoted string remains supported.

For the current platform, build an executable embedding `myapp.md` with:

```shell
npx jsmdcui --build-md-exe myapp.md
```

This is a convenience alias for
`--build-exe --define global.MDCUI_MAIN=myapp.md`.
The generated HTML images are embedded by Bun and can be displayed by the
compiled TUI. Add
`--define process.env.JSMDCUI_KITTY_MODE=compat` after the Markdown path when
the executable should enable Kitty-compatible images on a no-argument launch.

For cross-compilation, specify the Bun target before the Markdown file:

```shell
npx jsmdcui --build-md-for bun-linux-x64-v1.3.14 myapp.md
```

This similarly expands to
`--build-for bun-linux-x64-v1.3.14 --define global.MDCUI_MAIN=myapp.md`. Both aliases
are expanded before any generated application files are written.

Place every build define after `--build-exe`, or after the target argument of
`--build-for`. Choose at most one of `MDCUI_DEFAULT_EDIT`,
`MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO`, and `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI`.

| Build defines | No-argument launch | Open the same app in the other UI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | normal CLI/TUI | `./mdcui --wui app.md` |
| `MDCUI_DEFAULT_EDIT=1` | text editor | `./mdcui --tui app.md` |
| `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO=1` | `testapp.md` TUI | `./mdcui --wui --demo` |
| `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI=1` | `testapp.md` WUI | `./mdcui --tui --demo` |
| `global.MDCUI_MAIN=../中文工具.md` | embedded custom TUI | `./mdcui --wui --demo-中文工具` |
| MAIN plus `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI=1` | embedded custom WUI | `./mdcui --tui --demo-中文工具` |

Any explicit runtime argument suppresses the no-argument demo/WUI injection.
That is why the commands in the last column repeat `--demo` or
`--demo-中文工具`; `./mdcui --wui` by itself does not implicitly select a custom
main application.

To package `../中文工具.md` as a TUI by default:

```sh
bun src/index.js --build-exe \
  --define global.MDCUI_MAIN=../中文工具.md

./mdcui
./mdcui --wui --demo-中文工具
```

To package the same application as a WUI by default and explicitly switch back
to its TUI:

```sh
bun src/index.js --build-exe \
  --define global.MDCUI_MAIN=../中文工具.md \
  --define MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI=1

./mdcui
./mdcui --tui --demo-中文工具
```

The `MDCUI_MAIN` basename must end with lowercase `.md`. Its demo-name portion
must start with a Unicode letter or number and may contain Unicode
letters/numbers (including Chinese), combining marks, dots, underscores, and
hyphens. Whitespace and path separators are not allowed.

When the configured custom demo is selected and its local Markdown byte length
matches the embedded copy, TUI uses the embedded front/RPC modules and WUI uses
the embedded server. A missing demo, or one selected with
`MDCUI_OVERWRITE_DEMO=1`, is first written from the embedded copy and then uses
embedded modules. A different byte length prints a warning and uses filesystem
companion modules. Directly opening `./mdcui app.md` or
`./mdcui --wui app.md` has no demo provenance and therefore uses filesystem
modules even if the basename matches `MDCUI_MAIN`.

To retain the older repository-root `testapp.md` distribution instead, build a
TUI with:

```sh
bun src/index.js --build-exe \
  --define MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO=1 \
  --define MDCUI_OVERWRITE_DEMO=1
```

For a default WUI, replace `MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO` with
`MDCUI_DEFAULT_DEMO_WUI`.

You can rename and distribute the resulting binary. It contains the Bun
runtime, jsmdcui, the packed runtime assets, and the configured demo or custom
main application. The target directory must remain writable because launching
an application creates its Markdown file and generated companion files there.

## Development

```sh
npm run tui
npm run wui
npm run check
```

`testapp.md` is the main working example.
